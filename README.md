In this project, I’ve done some analysis and visualization on the Daily Wind Energy Production Capacity of Australia with the data available at Aneroid Energy.

I’ve built a web scraper to scrape the data from the public domain and made some analysis & visualization with the scraped data.

This project gives the audience a live visual of the data from the website whenever it’s updated all you need to do is just run each and every cell to get the new visual on the available data in an instant.
